#### Step 2: Review Event History

- **Access Event History**:
  - In the CloudTrail dashboard, click on 'Event history' in the left navigation pane.
  - Here you can see all the recent API activity in your AWS account, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.
- **Analyze Events**:
  - Browse through the list of events to find details about specific API calls, such as who made the call, the source IP, and the time of the call.
  - This information is important for auditing and security purposes, especially to trace any changes or deletions in your AWS environment.

#### Understanding CloudTrail Data

- **Event Log Details**:
  - Each event log provides comprehensive details that can help in understanding the context and impact of each action.
  - For example, if you have recently cleaned up resources from previous hands-on exercises, you can see delete actions logged with relevant details.
