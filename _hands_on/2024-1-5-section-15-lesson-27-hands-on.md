#### Reviewing Trusted Advisor Recommendations

- On the left-hand side, click through the categories such as **Cost Optimization**, **Performance**, **Security**, and **Fault Tolerance**.
- Note that while some basic checks are available for all users, comprehensive checks require a Business or Enterprise support plan.

#### Security Recommendations

- Specifically focus on the **Security** category. This section highlights critical security configurations and potential vulnerabilities.
- Review items marked with warnings or red flags, these indicate areas where action is needed to improve your security posture.

#### Exploring Free vs. Premium Checks

- Compare the access between the free and premium checks. Most operational and detailed performance recommendations are locked behind the premium plan.
- Evaluate whether the additional insights provided under a paid plan could benefit your organization based on the complexity of your AWS usage.
