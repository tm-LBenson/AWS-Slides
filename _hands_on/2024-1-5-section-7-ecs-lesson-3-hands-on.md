### Hands-On: AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. This hands-on guide will walk you through creating and testing a simple Lambda function using Node.js. By the end of this exercise, you will understand how Lambda responds to events and how to view its execution and output.

#### Step 1: Explore Lambda

- **Access Lambda**: Go to AWS Management Console > Services > Lambda.
- **Sandbox Interface**: Initially, select Node.js for the runtime and click 'Run' to see a simple execution.

#### Step 2: Interactive Animation

- **Event Response Simulation**: Watch the interactive animation showing how Lambda can respond to different events. This helps visualize data flow and function invocation.

#### Step 3: Create Your Function

- **Create Function**: Click 'Create function'.
- **Use Blueprint**: Choose the blueprint option and search for the 'hello-world' blueprint.
- **Configuration**:
  - **Runtime**: Select Node.js.
  - **Function Name**: Name your function 'helloWorld'.
  - **Permissions**: Use the default permissions provided.

#### Step 4: Test the Function

- **Analyze Code**: Review the automatically generated Node.js code to understand what your function does.
- **Testing**:
  - Click 'Test'.
  - Create a new test event named 'demoEvent'.
  - Keep the default template and modify values if necessary.
  - Click 'Save' then 'Test' again to execute your function.

#### Step 5: Monitoring and Logs

- **Monitoring**:
  - Navigate to the 'Monitoring' tab to see the function's metrics.
  - Click 'View logs in CloudWatch' to see detailed execution logs.
- **Configuration Adjustments**:
  - Note how you can adjust memory allocation and set the timeout for function execution.

#### Step 6: Understand Permissions

- **Permissions Tab**: Examine the permissions automatically associated with your Lambda function. This includes permissions for CloudWatch, which logs all function invocations.

#### Conclusion

This hands-on experience with AWS Lambda demonstrates the power and simplicity of serverless computing. You've seen how to deploy and monitor a simple function, which forms the basis for more complex applications. For the AWS exam, understanding the basic functionality and configuration of Lambda is essential. If you decide to pursue the AWS Developer Associate certification, deeper knowledge of Lambda will be crucial.
