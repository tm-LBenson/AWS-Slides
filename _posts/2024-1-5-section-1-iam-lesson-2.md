### IAM - Identity and Access Management

#### Introduction to IAM

Welcome to your introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is an essential service that helps you manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Understanding IAM is important for any AWS user, from administrators to developers.

- **Global Service**: IAM is a global service, meaning that when you configure IAM identities and permissions, they apply across all regions.
- **Role of IAM**: When creating an AWS account, setting up IAM is one of the first steps. It allows you to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

#### IAM - Permissions

Permissions in IAM are managed through policies, which are documents that define who has what permissions within your account. Let's dive deeper into how these work:

- **IAM Policies**: These are JSON formatted documents that clearly define what actions are allowed or denied on specific AWS resources.
- **Best Practices**: It's important to apply the principle of least privilegeâ€”only granting permissions necessary to perform a task. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes to your AWS environment.

This lesson sets the stage for more advanced IAM topics, including roles, groups, and identity federation. Understanding these basics is essential for securing your AWS environment and is a foundational aspect of all AWS certification exams.
