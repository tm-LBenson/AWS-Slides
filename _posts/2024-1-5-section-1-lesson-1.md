### Getting Started with AWS

#### Overview

Welcome to your first steps into the AWS Cloud! This lesson will guide you through understanding the basics of cloud computing and AWS.

#### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing provides on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Understanding these concepts will help you make informed decisions about resource provisioning and management.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Compute**: The processing power required to run applications and services.
  - **Storage**: Storing data securely in the cloud.
  - **Data Transfer**: Moving data in and out of the cloud.

Cloud computing allows you to access these resources without needing to invest in physical hardware.

- **Choosing an AWS Region**: Consider compliance, proximity to customers, availability of specific services, and pricing. This decision is important for optimizing performance and costs.

#### Service Models

Familiarize yourself with the different types of cloud services, which are commonly tested in AWS certification exams:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides fundamental computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networks. Example: Amazon EC2.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Example: Amazon QuickSight.

Understanding these models helps you choose the right solution for different scenarios.

#### Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

To understand the essence of cloud computing, let's look at its five key characteristics:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Provision computing capabilities as needed automatically.
2. **Broad Network Access**: Access resources over the network using standard mechanisms.
3. **Resource Pooling**: Serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model.
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Scale resources quickly based on demand.
5. **Measured Service**: Monitor, control, and report resource usage, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.

#### Setting Up a Budget

Monitoring and managing your AWS spending is important to avoid unexpected charges. AWS provides tools to set up budgets and alerts to help you keep track of your expenses.

- **Budget Types**: Cost budgets, usage budgets, and reservation budgets.
- **Setting Alerts**: Define conditions based on your estimated usage to receive notifications when your costs approach your budget limits.

#### Navigating the AWS Console

The AWS Management Console is your gateway to accessing and managing AWS services:

- **Region-Specific Service Availability**: Some AWS services are available only in certain regions. Always check service availability in your selected region.
- **AWS Free Tier**: Explore the AWS Free Tier to practice and experiment with AWS services at no cost for 12 months.

- **Service Categories**: Understand the different categories like Compute, Storage, Database, and Networking to effectively navigate the console.

This lesson sets the foundation for your AWS journey, preparing you for more advanced topics and practical experiences in the cloud.

#### Pricing Fundamentals of AWS

Understanding AWS pricing is critical for managing costs effectively. AWS pricing is based on three main fundamentals:

1. **Compute Costs**: Charges for the compute power you use.
2. **Storage Costs**: Charges for the data storage you use.
3. **Data Transfer Costs**: Charges for data transferred out of AWS services.

#### Shared Responsibility Model

The Shared Responsibility Model outlines the division of responsibilities between AWS and the customer:

- **AWS Responsibilities**: Security of the cloud infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and facilities.
- **Customer Responsibilities**: Security in the cloud, including data encryption, identity and access management, and application security.

Understanding this model is important for ensuring compliance and security in your AWS environment.
