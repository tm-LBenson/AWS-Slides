### IAM - Simplified User Management

#### Understanding IAM Policies

This section explores the basics of IAM policy management, focusing on policy assignment and inheritance. This is essential for effectively managing access and security in your AWS environment.

- **Policy Basics**: IAM policies are rules in JSON format that determine what actions users and groups can perform on AWS resources.
- **Policy Assignment**: You can directly attach policies to users or to groups. Attaching policies to groups helps in managing permissions collectively for users within those groups.

#### Types of Policies

There are two main types of IAM policies: custom and managed.

- **Custom Policies**: Tailored for specific needs, these are created by administrators. You can use the IAM policy editor to help build these policies.
- **Managed Policies**: Provided and maintained by AWS, these policies are designed to meet common permission configurations, like read-only access.

#### Key Security Practices

Itâ€™s crucial to implement strong security measures to protect your AWS resources.

- **Password Policies**: Enforce rules like password complexity and expiration to enhance security.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use MFA to add an extra security layer, crucial for protecting sensitive operations.
