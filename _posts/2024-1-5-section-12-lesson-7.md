AWS provides two distinct types of health dashboards that offer insights into service and account health, ensuring users are well-informed about incidents and scheduled maintenance that may affect their operations.

#### AWS Health Dashboard - Service History

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The AWS Health Dashboard, formerly known as the AWS Service Health Dashboard, shows the operational status and health of AWS services across all regions.
- **Historical Data**: It provides historical information about AWS service performance day-by-day, helping users identify and analyze past issues that may have affected their resources.
- **RSS Feed**: Users can subscribe to an RSS feed to receive real-time updates about service status changes, ensuring they are always informed of any operational disruptions.

#### AWS Health Dashboard â€” Your Account

- **Personalized Insights**: Previously called the AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD), this dashboard offers a personalized view of the health of AWS services that impact your specific AWS account.
- **Event Management**: It provides alerts and guidance for remediation if AWS experiences events that may impact your services, making it a important tool for incident response.
- **Proactive Notifications**: The dashboard not only helps manage ongoing events but also provides notifications about scheduled activities, helping you prepare and plan accordingly.
- **Organization-wide Aggregation**: For users managing multiple accounts under AWS Organizations, the dashboard can aggregate health data across the entire organization, providing a consolidated view of events and their impact.
