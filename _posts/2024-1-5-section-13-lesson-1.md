### Introduction to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

This lesson provides a high-level overview of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), focusing on the default VPC setup, which is important for understanding basic networking within AWS. We'll briefly cover the essential components and concepts needed for the exam.

#### Core Components of a VPC

- **VPC**: A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account within a region, providing isolation and control over AWS resources.
- **Subnets**: Divisions within a VPC that allow you to allocate IP ranges within different availability zones, enhancing resource deployment flexibility and fault tolerance.
- **Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways**: Facilitates communication between resources within your VPC and the internet. Internet Gateways allow public access, while NAT Gateways enable internet access for private subnets.

#### Security and Traffic Management

- **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)**: An additional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of subnets.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC, useful for monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

#### Connectivity Solutions

- **VPC Peering**: Allows you to connect two VPCs, enabling traffic to route between them using private IP addresses.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Enables private connections between your VPC and AWS services without requiring traffic to traverse the internet.
- **Site-to-Site VPN & Direct Connect**: Facilitates secure and private connectivity from an on-premises network to AWS or between AWS regions.
- **Transit Gateway**: A service that simplifies the networking and management of multiple VPCs and VPNs across your cloud environment.
