#### Key Features of Billing Alarms

- **Location of Billing Data**: Billing data metrics are stored in CloudWatch in the `us-east-1` region, regardless of where the services are being used.

- **Scope of Billing Data**: The metrics reflect the overall worldwide AWS costs, providing a consolidated view of expenditures across all regions and services.

- **Real Costs Monitoring**: Billing alarms are designed to alert based on actual costs incurred, not projected expenses. This feature is essential for maintaining budget control.

- **Comparison with AWS Budgets**: While useful, billing alarms in CloudWatch are not as advanced or flexible as AWS Budgets. They are intended for simple notifications rather than comprehensive budget management.

Understanding how to set up and use billing alarms can help in early detection of unexpected charges and keeping AWS spending under control.
