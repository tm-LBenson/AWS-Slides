#### Integration of Lex and Connect

- **Workflow Example**: A typical integration scenario involves a customer calling to schedule an appointment. Amazon Connect receives the call and uses Amazon Lex to interpret the customer's request through natural language. The intent is processed, and a Lambda function may be triggered to schedule the appointment directly into a CRM system.

This integration allows for a streamlined process that enhances customer experience by facilitating efficient and accurate communication, powered by advanced AWS technologies.
