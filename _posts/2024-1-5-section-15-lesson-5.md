### AWS Organization — Consolidated Billing

#### Why Consolidated Billing?

Imagine managing a large company where each department requires specific AWS access for their operations. You wouldn't expect employees to pay for their AWS usage. Instead, you'd centralize billing to manage costs effectively across your entire organization.

#### Benefits of Consolidated Billing

- **Combined Usage:** Combine the usage across all AWS accounts in the organization to share volume pricing, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans discounts.
- **One Bill:** Receive a single bill for all AWS Accounts within the organization.
- **Flexible Discount Management:** The management account can turn off Reserved Instances discount sharing for any account in the organization, including itself.
