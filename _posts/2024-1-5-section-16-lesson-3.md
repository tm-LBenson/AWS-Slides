### AWS Directory Services

AWS Directory Services provides a way to integrate AWS resources with Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This service allows you to use your existing corporate credentials to access AWS services and resources securely.

#### Understanding Microsoft Active Directory (AD)

- **Corporate Access Management**: If you've used a company computer that required a specific login that worked across multiple systems, that was likely powered by Microsoft AD.
- **Features**: Microsoft AD manages user credentials and access across a network, including password policies, printer access, and access to other Windows services.

#### AWS Directory Services Features

- **Integration with AWS**: Extends Microsoft AD capabilities into the AWS cloud, allowing seamless integration between on-premises AD infrastructures and AWS services.
- **Managed Service**: AWS handles the setup, maintenance, and scalability of the directory services, making it easier for AWS customers to focus on their applications.

#### Use Cases

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to sign in once and access multiple AWS services without re-authenticating.
- **Resource Access**: Manage and control access to AWS resources using group memberships and permissions defined in AD.

For the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, remember that AWS Directory Services enhances Microsoft Active Directory with AWS features.
