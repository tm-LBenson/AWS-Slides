### AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)

AWS IAM Identity Center simplifies user access to AWS accounts and business applications by providing a single sign-on (SSO) solution. This service enables centralized management of user access and identities across an organization.

#### Key Features

- **Single Sign-On**: One login provides access to all enabled AWS accounts and business applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and more.
- **Identity Providers**: Supports integration with third-party identity providers such as Active Directory, OneLogin, Okta, and others.
- **Built-in Identity Store**: Manage users directly within IAM Identity Center if no external identity provider is used.
- **Support for SAML 2.0**: Enables integration with SAML 2.0-enabled applications for broader application compatibility.

#### Practical Comparison

- **Similar to Microsoft 365**: Just as logging into Microsoft 365 gives access to various applications (Office apps, app store, email) under one account, IAM Identity Center provides a unified access point for numerous AWS services and external applications.

#### Use Case

- **Simplified Access Management**: Streamlines user access across multiple services, enhancing security by reducing the number of credentials users must manage.

For the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, focus on understanding that AWS IAM Identity Center offers an efficient way to manage access across multiple AWS accounts and external applications through a single login mechanism.
