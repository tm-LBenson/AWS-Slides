### Cloud Migration: The 7Rs Strategy

#### Overview

The 7Rs of cloud migration provide a strategic framework for organizations considering moving applications and services to the cloud. Each "R" represents a different approach to migration, depending on business needs, technical requirements, and other factors.

#### The 7Rs Explained

- **Retire**: Identify and eliminate applications that are no longer useful to reduce maintenance overhead and focus on resources that are truly needed.

- **Retain**: Keep applications on-premises or in their current environment when it makes the most sense due to regulatory, legal, or technological constraints.

- **Relocate**: Move applications to another data center or another cloud provider without major changes—sometimes referred to as "rehosting."

- **Rehost** ("Lift and Shift"): Move applications to the cloud without changes. This is often the fastest migration strategy but may not offer cost optimizations inherent to cloud-native features.

- **Replatform** ("Lift and Reshape"): Make minor adjustments to applications to take advantage of cloud capabilities without changing the core architecture, such as changing the database to a managed service.

- **Repurchase** ("Drop and Shop"): Move from a traditional license to a cloud service model, like moving from an on-prem CRM to Salesforce or from an on-prem ERP to NetSuite.

- **Refactor / Re-architect**: Reimagine how the application is architected and developed, typically using cloud-native technologies, to enhance agility, performance, and scalability.

#### Choosing the Right Strategy

The choice of strategy depends on various factors including the application’s strategic importance, the complexity of the migration, and the desired benefits of moving to the cloud. The decision is often a balance between cost, time, and the intended outcome.
