#### Key Differences from Other AWS Services

- **Amazon SNS and SES**: While both services are great for delivering messages, they do not offer the advanced targeting, scheduling, and campaign management features that Pinpoint provides.
- **Campaign Management**: Unlike SNS, which is primarily used for notifications, Pinpoint allows for the creation of complex marketing campaigns with templates, automated responses, and detailed analytics.
