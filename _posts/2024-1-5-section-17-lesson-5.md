### AWS AppSync Overview

AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to enable apps to fetch, manipulate, and subscribe to data from multiple sources in real time. AppSync simplifies application development by handling data synchronization and communication.

#### Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Updates data in real-time with subscriptions.
- **Offline Support**: Supports local data access and modification when devices are offline, syncing the changes when reconnected.
- **Security**: Offers fine-grained access control to data based on user roles and permissions.

#### Use Cases

- Mobile applications that need to provide users with immediate updates.
- Applications that require offline data access and synchronization.
- Web applications that aggregate data from multiple databases and APIs.

AWS AppSync integrates well with AWS DynamoDB and AWS Lambda, allowing for powerful backend solutions. It also supports automatic client code generation, making it easier to develop robust, efficient applications.

Remember: If the exam references GraphQL or real-time data synchronization, think of AWS AppSync.
