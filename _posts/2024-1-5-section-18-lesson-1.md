### AWS Architecting & Ecosystem

#### Well Architected Framework

General Guiding Principles

- **Stop guessing your capacity needs**: Utilize scalable systems that allow for flexible capacity planning rather than fixed predictions.
- **Test systems at production scale**: Ensure systems are tested under real-world loads to verify performance under peak conditions.
- **Automate to make architectural experimentation easier**: Use automation to create and tear down environments, making it easier to innovate and experiment.
- **Allow for evolutionary architectures**: Design systems that can evolve and adapt over time as business needs and technologies change.
- **Design based on changing requirements**: Be flexible in design to accommodate changes without significant redesigns.
- **Drive architectures using data**: Use real-time data to make decisions and adjustments, enhancing responsiveness and efficiency.
- **Improve through game days**: Regularly scheduled events to simulate unexpected failures or changes to test the robustness of systems.
- **Simulate applications for flash sale days**: Test applications' ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic, as seen during sales or marketing events.

#### AWS Cloud Best Practices â€” Design Principles

- **Scalability**: Implement both vertical (upgrading existing resources) and horizontal (adding more resources) scaling methods.
- **Disposable Resources**: Design servers and resources to be easily disposable, replaceable, and reconfigurable without causing disruptions.
- **Automation**: Embrace serverless architectures, Infrastructure as Code, and auto-scaling features to minimize manual tasks and errors.
- **Loose Coupling**:
  - Break large applications (monoliths) into smaller, independent components that can function and fail without affecting others.
  - Isolates failures and changes to specific components without cascading issues.
- **Services, not Servers**:
  - Move beyond relying solely on servers like EC2; leverage managed services and serverless options to reduce operational overhead and focus on functionality.

#### Well Architected Framework - 6 Pillars

- **1) Operational Excellence**
- **2) Security**
- **3) Reliability**
- **4) Performance Efficiency**
- **5) Cost Optimization**
- **6) Sustainability**
- These pillars are integral and synergistic, not merely trade-offs or balancing acts.

- The next 6 lessons will discuss these pillars in depth.
