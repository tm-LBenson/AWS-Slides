#### Capabilities

- **Chaos Engineering**: Intentionally inject faults into your systems to simulate real-world issues such as high CPU load, network latency, or system outages.

- **Support for Multiple AWS Services**: While FIS supports a variety of AWS services including EC2, ECS, EKS, and RDS, the focus is not on service-specific features but on how these services handle stress under adverse conditions.

- **Pre-built Templates**: Utilize templates within FIS to create disruptions, making it easier to start and standardize fault injection experiments.

#### Benefits

- **Identify Weak Points**: Helps discover vulnerabilities and areas of improvement in your application’s architecture and operational responses.

- **Improve System Reliability**: By understanding how applications behave under stress, teams can enhance system design and operational procedures.

- **Streamlined Fault Injection**: FIS simplifies the process of introducing and managing chaos experiments, enabling teams to focus on results and improvements rather than setup and execution details.
