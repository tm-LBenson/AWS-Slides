### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence involves the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

#### Design Principles

- **Perform operations as code**: Utilize infrastructure as code to manage and automate your systems more efficiently and consistently.
- **Annotate documentation**: Automatically generate annotated documentation after each build to ensure accuracy and up-to-dateness.
- **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**: Implement changes that are small enough to be reversible without significant disruption, facilitating easier troubleshooting and faster recovery.
- **Refine operations procedures frequently**: Regularly update and improve operational procedures to enhance team efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Anticipate failure**: Design systems with the expectation of failure in mind, implementing fallback and recovery procedures to maintain operational stability.
- **Learn from all operational failures**: Treat failures as learning opportunities, using them to improve system resilience and reliability.
