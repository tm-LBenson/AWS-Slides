### Security

Security within the AWS Well-Architected Framework encompasses the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

#### Design Principles

- **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Centralize privilege management and enforce the principle of least privilege using IAM to minimize reliance on long-term credentials.
- **Enable traceability**: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real-time. Integrate logs and metrics with automated response systems to ensure swift actions.
- **Apply security at all layers**: Add security at each layer of your architecture, from the edge network to VPCs, subnets, load balancers, instances, operating systems, and applications.
- **Automate security best practices**: Use automation to apply security at scale, efficiently managing complex configurations and reducing human error.
- **Protect data in transit and at rest**: Secure your data through encryption, tokenization, and strict access controls to ensure integrity and confidentiality.
- **Keep people away from data**: Minimize direct access to data by using automated tools to handle and process data securely.
- **Prepare for security events**: Continually practice incident response, simulate security events to test your preparedness, and implement automated tools to aid in rapid detection, investigation, and recovery.

Understanding and applying these principles ensures robust security measures are embedded within every aspect of your cloud architecture.
