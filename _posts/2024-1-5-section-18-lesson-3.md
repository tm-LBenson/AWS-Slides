### Amazon AppStream 2.0 Overview

Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a desktop application streaming service that allows businesses to deliver desktop applications to any computer through **a web browser.** (Not a desktop environment like Workspaces) This service simplifies application management and accessibility, eliminating the need for extensive infrastructure and traditional application deployment methods.

#### Key Features

- **Accessibility**: Users can access applications from any device capable of running a web browser, providing flexibility and convenience.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to meet user demand without the need for physical hardware provisioning.
- **Security**: Applications run on AWS, isolating the application infrastructure from the user's device, which enhances security.

#### Use Cases

- Businesses that require providing their workforce with access to desktop applications without the complexity of managing end-user devices.
- Educational institutions that need to deliver software for classes without requiring students to install specific applications on their personal computers.

Amazon AppStream 2.0 offers a user-friendly, secure, and cost-effective solution for delivering applications directly to users, irrespective of their physical location.
