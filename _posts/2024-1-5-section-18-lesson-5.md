### Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficiency in the AWS Well-Architected Framework involves using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements while maintaining that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

#### Design Principles

- **Democratize advanced technologies**: Use advanced technologies that are made available as AWS services to focus on product development instead of infrastructure management.
- **Go global in minutes**: Easily deploy applications across multiple regions to enhance performance and reduce latency.
- **Use serverless architectures**: Leverage serverless computing to eliminate the overhead of server management and scaling.
- **Experiment more often**: Facilitate comparative testing to find the best solutions without significant upfront costs.
- **Mechanical sympathy**: Understand and effectively use the broad spectrum of AWS services to achieve the most efficient system performance.

Implementing these principles allows organizations to adapt to new requirements and technologies efficiently, ensuring optimal performance across their applications and services.
