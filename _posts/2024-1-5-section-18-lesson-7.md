#### Design Principles

- **Understand your impact**: Establish key performance indicators and continuously evaluate improvements.
- **Establish sustainability goals**: Set achievable, long-term environmental goals for each workload and model their return on investment.
- **Maximize utilization**: Right-size each workload to maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources.
- **Anticipate and adopt more efficient offerings**: Stay flexible to integrate new, more efficient hardware and software over time.
- **Use managed services**: Leverage shared services to reduce the overall infrastructure footprint and automate sustainable best practices, such as moving infrequently accessed data to cold storage or adjusting compute capacity to need.
- **Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads**: Minimize the energy or resources required for your services, thereby reducing the need for customers to upgrade their devices.

These principles help organizations optimize their cloud infrastructure in an environmentally conscious manner, ensuring that cloud operations contribute positively to sustainability goals.
