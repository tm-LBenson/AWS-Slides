### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization in the AWS Well-Architected Framework focuses on running systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

<!-- pagebreak -->

#### Design Principles

- **Adopt a consumption model**: Only pay for computing resources that you actually use.
- **Measure overall efficiency**: Utilize tools like AWS CloudWatch to monitor and manage efficiency across all resources.
- **Stop spending money on data center operations**: AWS manages the infrastructure, allowing organizations to focus more on projects and less on hardware.
- **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: Use tagging to accurately identify system usage and costs to measure Return on Investment (ROI).
- **Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership**: Leveraging managed services can lead to lower costs per transaction or service due to economies of scale.
