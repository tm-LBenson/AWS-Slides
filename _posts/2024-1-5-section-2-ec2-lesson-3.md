### EC2 Instance Types Explained

Understanding different EC2 instance types is important for optimizing application performance and cost efficiency. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the primary categories:

#### General Purpose Instances

- **Overview**: General purpose instances offer a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for diverse workloads such as web servers, development environments, and small databases.
- **Examples**: Families include `t2`, `t3`, `m4`, and `m5`.
