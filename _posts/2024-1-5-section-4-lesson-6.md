### EC2 Instance Store Overview

An EC2 instance store provides temporary block-level storage for Amazon EC2 instances. Unlike Elastic Block Store (EBS), which is persistent, instance store storage is ephemeral and has specific use cases. Here's an overview of EC2 instance store and its key characteristics:

#### What is an EC2 Instance Store?

- An instance store is physical storage located on the host hardware where your EC2 instance is running.
- It offers high throughput and low latency because it's directly attached to the instance's host hardware.
- However, it's not persistent storageâ€”data is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails due to hardware issues.

#### Characteristics of EC2 Instance Store

- **Temporary Storage**
  - Data stored in an instance store is lost when the instance is stopped, terminated, or experiences hardware failure.
  - This makes instance store ideal for temporary data, caching, or scratch space but not for critical or permanent data.
- **High Performance**
  - Instance store offers high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for applications requiring fast read/write operations.
- **Limited Scope**
  - Instance stores are only available for certain EC2 instance types. Some instance families do not support instance stores.
- **Use with Caution**
  - Since instance store data is not persistent, it should be used for temporary storage, not for data that needs to be retained across reboots or terminations.

#### Use Cases for EC2 Instance Store

- **Temporary Data Storage**
  - Instance store is useful for temporary data, such as cache files, logs, or intermediary processing results.
- **High-Performance Applications**
  - Due to its high throughput, instance store can be used for applications requiring fast disk I/O, such as big data analytics, scientific computing, or media processing.
- **Scratch Space**
  - Instance store can serve as scratch space for operations that don't require data persistence beyond the life of the instance.

#### Instance Store Volumes

- **Ephemeral Storage**
  - Instance store volumes are also known as ephemeral storage because data is lost when the instance is terminated or stopped.
- **Auto-Configuration**
  - When you launch an EC2 instance with instance store volumes, they are automatically attached and mounted at specific paths (like `/dev/sda1`).
- **Backup Strategies**
  - To preserve important data, use persistent storage like EBS or regular backups to Amazon S3.

EC2 instance store offers high-performance, temporary storage for EC2 instances. However, it's important to understand its limitations and use it appropriately to avoid data loss.
