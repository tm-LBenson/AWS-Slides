### Implementing Scaling Strategies

Implementing these strategies involves setting parameters in the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or through the AWS SDKs. Here's a brief guide on how to set up each:

#### **Manual Scaling**

- Through the AWS Management Console, select your ASG and adjust the "Desired Capacity" manually. This gives you direct control over the number of instances running at any time.

#### **Dynamic Scaling**

- **Step 1**: Create scaling policies in the ASG settings. These policies respond to CloudWatch alarms that you define based on metrics such as CPU usage.
- **Step 2**: Define the CloudWatch alarms that trigger your scaling policies. For example, you might create an alarm to trigger a scaling policy when CPU utilization exceeds 70% for more than five minutes.

#### **Scheduled Scaling**

- **Step 1**: Use the AWS Management Console to define scheduled actions for your ASG.
- **Step 2**: Specify the start time and end time (if applicable) for when these actions should occur.
- **Step 3**: Set the new minimum, maximum, and desired capacities that will automatically adjust according to the schedule, such as increasing capacity during business hours or ahead of known traffic increases.
