### S3 Bucket Policies

- **Format**: JSON-based policies that define access permissions.
- **Resources**: Policies can specify conditions for both buckets and objects within those buckets.
- **Effects**: Determine whether to allow or deny specific actions.
- **Actions**: Include a set of API calls that can be allowed or denied, such as `s3:GetObject` or `s3:PutObject`.
- **Principals**: Specify which AWS account or service can access the resources. This is useful for setting up cross-account access.

#### Example Uses of S3 Bucket Policies

- **Public Access**: Grant read access to everyone for a specific bucket or for all objects within a bucket.
- **Enforce Encryption on Upload**: Require that all uploads to a bucket must use server-side encryption.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Allow another AWS account to access objects in your bucket, useful for shared environments or when integrating with third-party services.
