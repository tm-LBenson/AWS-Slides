#### CloudFormation

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automates the deployment of infrastructure across AWS, allowing for the repeatable setup of environments across different regions and accounts.

#### Elastic Beanstalk

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Simplifies the deployment of applications by handling the infrastructure, including common combinations like ALB + EC2 + RDS, while limiting to specific programming languages or Docker.

#### AWS CodeDeploy

- **Hybrid Deployment**: Allows the deployment and upgrading of applications onto both AWS services and on-premises servers.

#### AWS Systems Manager

- **Hybrid Management**: Provides tools for patch management, configuration, and execution of commands across AWS and on-premises environments.

#### AWS Developer Tools

- **CodeCommit**: A managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories, ensuring secure version control of your code.
- **CodeBuild**: Compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages within AWS.
- **CodeDeploy**: Automates software deployments to various compute services such as EC2, Lambda, and on-premises servers.
- **CodePipeline**: Automates the phases of the release process, integrating with other services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to form a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- **CodeArtifact**: Manages software packages and dependencies, integrating with common package managers like npm, yarn, and pip.
- **CodeStar**: Provides a unified user interface to manage software development activities seamlessly across AWS services.

#### AWS Cloud9

- **Cloud-Based IDE**: Offers a collaborative environment for coding, running, and debugging code directly within a browser.

#### AWS CDK

- **Infrastructure Definition**: Allows developers to define their cloud resources using familiar programming languages, transforming into CloudFormation templates.
