### AWS CodePipeline Overview

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. CodePipeline automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change, based on the release model you define. This lesson explores the capabilities of AWS CodePipeline and its role in automating the steps from code change to deployment.

#### Key Features of AWS CodePipeline

- **Modular Design**: CodePipeline allows you to define your build and deployment processes as a series of stages, with each stage representing a part of the CI/CD process. These stages can include actions like building code, running tests, or deploying to production.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, as well as third-party tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and TeamCity.

- **Customizable Workflows**: You can customize the workflow to suit your development, testing, and production needs. This includes setting up different actions and transitions between actions, ensuring that the software release aligns with business, technical, and regulatory standards.
