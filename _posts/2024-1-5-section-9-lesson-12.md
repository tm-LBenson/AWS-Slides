#### Key Features of Parameter Store

- **Hierarchical Storage**: Organize data in a hierarchical structure for efficient management and retrieval. For instance, you can store configurations by environment (e.g., dev, test, prod) and application components.

- **Version Control**: Parameter Store supports versioning of configuration data, enabling you to manage changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, allowing for secure retrieval of configuration data during the runtime of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and more.
