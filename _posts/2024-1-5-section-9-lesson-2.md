### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Overview

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) revolutionizes infrastructure management by allowing developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, or TypeScript. This lesson introduces the AWS CDK, explaining how it enables efficient deployment of both infrastructure and application runtime code.

#### What is AWS CDK?

- **Programmatic Infrastructure**: CDK allows you to define your cloud resources with an intuitive, imperative programming model instead of writing verbose JSON or YAML templates.

- **Language Support**: With CDK, you can use programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, or C# to model your cloud infrastructure, leveraging existing language features and libraries.

- **Integration with CloudFormation**: CDK synthesizes your application into a CloudFormation template, enabling reliable deployment and management of resources.

#### Key Features of AWS CDK

- **Integration with AWS Services**: CDK provides high-level components called constructs, which preconfigure cloud resources with sensible defaults to create complex cloud architectures easily.

- **Extendable Framework**: You can customize constructs or compose multiple constructs together to encapsulate common patterns specific to your application.

- **CDK CLI**: The toolkit includes a command line interface that allows you to interact with CDK applications, synthesize artifacts such as CloudFormation Templates, and deploy resources directly.

#### Example CDK Script

Below is a snippet of JavaScript that outlines creating an ECS cluster with Fargate services using CDK. The example also sets up related networking resources like VPC and an Application Load Balancer.

- **CDK Code Snippet**:

  ```js
  export class MyEcsConstructStack extends core.Stack {
    constructor(scope: core.App, id: string, props?: core.StackProps) {
      super(scope, id, props);

      const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {
        maxAzs: 3, // Default is all AZs in region
      });

      const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
        vpc: vpc,
      });

      // Create a load-balanced Fargate service and make it public
      new ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(
        this,
        'MyFargateService',
        {
          cluster: cluster, // Required
          cpu: 512, // Default is 256
          desiredCount: 6, // Default is 1
          taskImageOptions: {
            image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry('amazon/amazon-ecs-sample'),
          },
          memoryLimitMiB: 2048, // Default is 512
          publicLoadBalancer: true, // Default is false
        },
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- **Note**: This code snippet demonstrates the setup of several AWS resources: EC2 VPC, ECS cluster, and an Application Load Balanced Fargate service.
