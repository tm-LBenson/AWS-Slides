#### Key Features of AWS CodeCommit

- **Collaboration**: Similar to GitHub, CodeCommit enables multiple developers to collaborate on code, with features like pull requests, branch policies, and merge options to manage code reviews and contributions effectively.

- **Security**: CodeCommit stores your repositories in the AWS Cloud, offering encryption at rest and in transit, along with integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.

- **Scalability**: As a managed service, CodeCommit can scale seamlessly to meet the needs of both small development teams and large enterprise projects.
