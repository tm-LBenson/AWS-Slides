### AWS Global Accelerator

#### Introduction to AWS Global Accelerator

AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability and performance of your applications with users globally. It leverages the AWS global network to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS backbone network.

#### Key Features

- **Anycast IPs**: Provides two fixed Anycast IP addresses that serve as a fixed entry point to your applications and route traffic through the AWS global network infrastructure.
- **Edge Locations**: Uses the AWS edge locations to route traffic more efficiently to your applications in AWS regions.
- **Performance**: Optimizes the path to your application to improve performance and reduce internet latency.

#### Differences Between CloudFront and Global Accelerator

While both services aim to improve performance and availability of applications globally, there are key differences:

- **Caching**: CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches copies of content at edge locations worldwide. Global Accelerator does not cache content but routes traffic to optimize connectivity and performance.
- **Static IP**: Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses as a fixed entry point to your applications, making it suitable for use cases that require a consistent IP address for DNS management or whitelisting.
- **Traffic Handling**: Unlike CloudFront, which serves content directly from edge locations, Global Accelerator routes user traffic to the nearest AWS region where your application is deployed. This ensures traffic is handled by the application in a more direct path, improving response times and reducing latency.

#### Use Cases

AWS Global Accelerator is particularly effective for:

- **Non-cacheable Content**: Applications that require dynamic content delivery, which cannot benefit from traditional caching mechanisms.
- **Global Reach with Low Latency**: Services that need consistent, quick response times globally.
- **Simplifying IP Management**: Applications that benefit from having fixed IP addresses for simplified DNS setups or regulatory requirements.

AWS Global Accelerator enhances your application's performance by leveraging the AWS global network to efficiently route traffic. Understanding the distinctions between Global Accelerator and CloudFront is important for architects designing solutions that require robust, global access with low latency.
